            <dd>Do you like burgers? Give the answer here and write a short note about it.</dd>
            <p>Yes, I do like burgers. A burger is a popular sandwich featuring a cooked ground meat patty served
                between two slices of bread. It can be made from ground beef, chicken, turkey, or plant-based
                alternatives. Burgers offer versatility in customization, offering a wide range of buns,
                toppings, and fillings. They are flavorful, satisfying, and convenient, combining juicy meat with savory
                ingredients, often found in fast-food chains and restaurants for quick meals.</p>

            <dd>Do you like pizza? Give the answer here and write a short note about it.</dd>
            <p>Pizza is my favourite. Pizza is a flat bread dough base baked in an oven, typically made from wheat
                flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. The base is thin and crispy, while the toppings can vary based
                on personal preferences and regional variations. It offers a delicious flavor profile with a combination
                of savory sauce, melted cheese, and diverse toppings. Pizzas are cooked in high-temperature ovens,
                resulting in a hot, melty, and flavorful dish. They are often served in slices, making them easy to eat
                and share. Pizza is enjoyed worldwide, both in casual settings and high-end restaurants, offering a
                versatile and satisfying meal option for people of all ages.</p>

            <dd>Do you like french fries? Give the answer here and write a short note about it.</dd>
            <p>French fries are my go-to option for a casual dining! French fries are a popular side dish made from
                deep-fried potatoes, resulting in a crispy golden exterior and soft interior. They are typically long,
                thin, and seasoned with salt or spices. They are often found in fast-food restaurants, diners, and food
                stalls, but can also be made at home using deep fryers or oven-baking methods.French fries are enjoyed
                by many due to their crispy texture, versatility as a standalone snack or side dish, and delicious
                flavor.</p>

            <dd>Do you like chocolate cake? Give the answer here and write a short note about it.</dd>
            <p>A chocolate cake is a must for my birthday. Nothing beats a good chocolate cake melting in your mouth on
                a good day. Chocolate cake is a moist, rich dessert with chocolate as its main flavor. It is made by
                combining cocoa powder or melted chocolate with flour, sugar, eggs, butter, or oil, and leavening
                agents. The cake is baked in the oven until it rises and forms a soft, tender crumb. The addition of
                chocolate frosting enhances the overall taste of baked cake, providing a sweet and chocolaty element.

            <dd>Do you like pudding? Give the answer here and write a short note about it.</dd>
            <p>Pudding is one of my favourite dessert and a must-have option after dinner or lunch gathering. People
                love pudding! Its creamy and smooth texture provides a satisfying eating experience. It is made from milk, cream, sugar, and a
                thickening agent. Flavors like chocolate, vanilla, butterscotch, caramel, or fruit can be added to
                create variations. Pudding is versatile and can be layered with cookies or fruit, used as a filling for
                pies or pastries, or as a base for trifles and parfaits. </p>
